Description about my project
The main goal of this project is to design and implement a traffic security system based on Raspberry Pi 3(latest version of raspberry pi device) which can be deployed on the traffic red lights and highways. Using this system, we can detect if there’s water logging on the road, if there’s fire on the road, condition of the road, and anyone who is breaking the traffic red light.

The main advantage of traffic security system is it is better than any other security systems. This system consist of a Water Sensor(which sense if there’s water logging on the road), an IR sensor(activated when light is red, and checks if anyone is breaking it), a Smoke Sensor(to detect 
If there’s fire on the road) and traffic red light(green and red LED’s), a Web Camera to instantly click photos of any situation. .Whenever any of these sensor is activated we receive a message on our device (cell phone) and the PUTTY software we are using is used to activate our raspberry pi device and system. We also use a drop box which stores all the pictures that our webcam is clicking. Therefore with the help of this message and picture system we can instantly notify the specific authority so they can respond as soon as possible.
